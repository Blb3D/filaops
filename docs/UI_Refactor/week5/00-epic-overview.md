# Week 5: Operation-Level Production Tracking

## Status: SPECS COMPLETE ✅

---

## Epic Overview

Transform FilaOps from single-step production orders to true multi-operation routing execution. This enables real manufacturing workflows like Print → Clean → Assemble → QC → Pack/Ship.

---

## Problem Statement

**Current State:**
- Production orders treated as single task
- Completing PO marks everything done (skips intermediate ops)
- Scheduler books entire PO to one resource
- Material blocking checks ALL BOM items upfront
- Double-booking resources is possible
- No progress visibility during production
- 2-hour hardcoded duration ignores BOM/routing times

**Real World Workflow:**
```
PO: Make Gadget Pro (50 units)
├── Op 10: Print       → Printer-01, 4 hrs, consumes PLA
├── Op 20: Clean       → Finishing, 30 min
├── Op 30: Assemble    → Assembly, 1 hr, consumes hardware kit
├── Op 40: QC Inspect  → QC Station, 15 min
└── Op 50: Pack/Ship   → Shipping, 10 min, consumes boxes
```

**Key Insight:** Shipping boxes not received yet? **Start printing anyway** - they'll arrive by the time we get to Op 50.

## Success Criteria

1. ✅ Operations have status transitions (pending → running → complete)
2. ⏳ Can define routing with 5 operations for a product
3. ⏳ Releasing PO creates 5 operation records
4. ⏳ Starting Op 1 sets PO to in_progress
5. ⏳ Completing Op 1 auto-advances current to Op 2
6. ⏳ Materials for Op 3 don't block starting Op 1
7. ⏳ Cannot schedule two operations on same resource at same time
8. ⏳ Progress bar shows operation status
9. ⏳ PO only complete when final operation complete

---

## Operation Status Flow
```
pending → queued → running → complete
                      ↓
                   skipped (with reason)
```

## PO Status Derived from Operations

| Condition | PO Status |
|-----------|-----------|
| All ops `pending` | `released` |
| Any op `running`, not all done | `in_progress` |
| All ops `complete` or `skipped` | `complete` |

---

## Technical Notes

### Consume Stage Mapping (API-402)
| consume_stage | Operation Codes | Materials |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------|
| `production` | PRINT, EXTRUDE | Filament, raw materials |
| `assembly` | ASSEMBLE, BUILD | Hardware, subassemblies |
| `shipping` | PACK, SHIP | Boxes, labels, packaging |

### Conflict Detection (API-403)
```python
# Two operations conflict if:
# - Same resource_id
# - Time ranges overlap: (start1 < end2) AND (start2 < end1)
# - Neither is in terminal state (complete, skipped, cancelled)
```

---

## Out of Scope (Future)

- Parallel operations (print two parts simultaneously)
- Operation-level labor time tracking
- Automated Bambu status sync to operation progress
- Rework routing (failed QC → back to earlier op)
- Gantt drag-drop rescheduling

---

## Dependencies

- ✅ Routing data exists for test products
- ✅ Work centers configured with resources
- ✅ UOM table seeded (completed Week 4)
